hsqml-demo-notes
================

This sticky notes program using HsQML was introduced in my November 2014 talk
to the London Haskell User Group. The 'hsqml-notes' executable can be passed
an argument to specify which QML front-end to use:

notes      - Stardard UI (default)
notes-pro  - Alternative UI using Qt Quick Controls
notes-flip - Standard UI with flipable double-sided notes
notes-dual - Standard and alternate UI displayed simultaneously
